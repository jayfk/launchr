            <li>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software)
              on {{ company }}'s website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is
              the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

                <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
                <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or

              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be

              violation of rights.

            <li>Further, {{ company }} does not warrant or make any representations concerning the

            without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the

            if {{ company }} or a {{ company }} authorized representative has been
            notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow
            limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages,

            contained on its website at any time without notice. However {{ company }} does not make
            any commitment to update the materials.</p>
          <h3 class="pt-3">6. Links</h3>
          <p>{{ company }} has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not
            responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement

            service.</p>
